          My Revised Learning Plan
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h4 style="width: 100%; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 30px;">
          My Goal
        </h4>
        <p>
          I’m hoping to use the skills to start taking small contract jobs as a side business in addition to my current job in the short run. In the long run, I’d prefer to make a complete pivot of my career pathway to either become a programmer or start a business that combines my knowledge of accounting and programming. I love how Dev Academy sees the importance of core learning and this is an experience that I’ve never had during my accounting learning. I believe that the accounting world will be changed dramatically in a very short time of period due to the fast-paced development of programming. I’d like to form part of it. I want to be a pioneer instead of a follower.

          Strengths and limitations | Cognitive Self 
        </h4>
        <p>
          Most of my strengths and limitations are still the same. However, I did notice in the last sprint of the Foundations course that if I spent too long stuck in a problem that seems to be way beyond my knowledge and understanding, I start to question myself. Luckily, I only questioned myself this one time in the Foundations course. As Bootcamp is much more intense, this can become one of my limitations and I need to watch out for it.

          Non-tech Challenge at Bootcamp
        </h4>
        <p>
          Sometimes I push myself too hard and I’ll lose interest for a short while. This is the non-technical challenge that I need to face. In the Foundations course, I kept completing the challenges one week ahead of the schedule partially because I have two kids (one of them is a baby!) to attend to. But deep down inside, I know I did this because of my ego, I wanted to look smart or look good. This actually does no good to anyone. This is not the growth mind. I need to work on that.

          Non-tech Development for Me
        </h4>
        <p>
          I have a little fear to speak in front of the public. I will have many butterflies in my tummy. I always have too many worries about my English, my content, my look, and I am especially worried when I see someone in the audience that looks bored. But funnily, I’m good to speak in front of a small team and I quite enjoy it. Fewer people brings me less nervousness.

          My Expectation from Bootcamp Team
        </h4>
        <p>
          Leilani, my foundation facilitator, has been very cheering during the whole course. I found talking to her at the beginning of each week had encouraged me to achieve better in the week. When I had any technique issues, she also responded very fast. I think positive, efficient and clear communication is the type of support that I favour.      
        </p>
        <h4 style="width: 100%; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          My Expectation from Myself
        </h4>
        <p>
          If I have any questions and Google cannot answer me, my first go-to is the Slack channel to see if any of my peers can help. Thankfully there are always some peers that are super supportive and helpful. If that does not solve my problem, I will reach out to my tech facilitator and move on to my next task (and maybe take a short break first) before my facilitator get back to me. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My plan is to stick with the programme’s schedule. If I have extra time, try to improve my code, or do more research on the relative topic. If I’m behind, well, try to catch up but also reach out to both my core and tech facilitators for support or advice.

          My First Learning Plan
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h4 style="width: 100%; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 20px;">
          My Goal
        </h4>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to become a developer and maybe I can combine this and my accounting profession to create something unique. Depending on my financial situation, if I had to keep my accounting career pathway, I’ll see if I can work on any small projects as a contractor. Otherwise, the plan is to switch my career path right after this Bootcamp. Either way, I will stick to my long term goal.      
        </p>
        <h4 style="width: 100%; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 20px;">Pros and Cons</h4>
        <p>
          There are some attributes of me that will be quite helpful in surviving, or thriving (even better), this foundation and Bootcamp. I have strong self-motivation and I can handle stress well. I can focus on learning for hours and not feel exhausted. In fact, I get excited because I grow as I learn. However, sometimes I get lost in details. It could cost me a couple of hours before I realize that. This habit is not affordable during Bootcamp given how intense it would be. I am on a solution - I’ve been using Toggl since the start of the foundation to correct this habit of mine.    
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to teamwork during the Bootcamp, there is one skill that I definitely need to improve on. That is my communication. I tend to under-communicate. I assume people have the same level of information and come from the same background as I do. I know that over-communication is the key to achieving any teamwork and this is an obstacle that I must overcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a practical person and I know how to arrange my time. I keep a priority list based on the deadline and importance of each task. As for team projects, I’ll do the same plus share my priority list and live progress tracker with my teammates and my facilitators if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          If things are building up and starting to get to me, I will take a 20 minutes break to go for a walk or talk to a friend or even just sit in the backyard and look at the sky. This has been extremely helpful to take the stress off me or when I get irritated by something. When I start to take my 20 minutes break often, this will be a signal for me to reach out for help. I think twice a day can be the signal. In addition, I do 3 or 4 times exercises per week to keep myself pumped, both physically and emotionally.
        </p>
        <h4 style="width: 100%; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 20px;">Potential Help Needed</h4>
        <p>
          I expect some general guidance when I get lost in the program or when I start to think small of myself. Some cheering words from time to time can be nice - unexpected praise or recognition can make someone’s day.          
        </p>
        <p>
          There shouldn’t be any block-out times during my Bootcamp journey. By the time we start BootCamp, my preschooler will be schooling and my baby will be attending daycare. My husband will do all the drop-offs and pick-ups. If occasionally he can’t do it, I will let the team and my facilitator know. Although, if anything goes sideways, I will reach out to my facilitator immediately to seek advice.
