        Neuroplasticity
      </h4>
      <p>
        The idea of neuroplasticity is that everyone’s brain is capable of being reshaped, even adults. The brain activities are not predetermined by our DNA. In fact, it is almost like our muscles - we can work hard to grow them. Understanding this will open a whole new world for us. There is actually no limit to how much we can achieve in anything. As long as we keep practising, eventually, we will become what we want. There may be genius born this way. But everyone can become a genius and the only thing we need to do is to believe in ourselves and to work on it. Like said in the orientation of this course, anyone can do programming.      
      <p>
        When we did the values, identities and strengths in sprint 1, we also did list our weaknesses. I used to think those weaknesses are unchangeable because they form part of me. It is who I am. But now I believe that I just need to practice to improve on my weaknesses and make them my strengths. It may take long and lots of efforts, but it is doable.
      </p>
      <p>
        For anything I want to learn or achieve, I just need to reflect on those little by little, day by day. My neuroplasticity related to these areas will grow to be stronger. There will be more cells wired up and I shall keep reflecting to keep my neuroplasticity active.
      </p>

        When I was researching on how to become a better parent, I came across this book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whole-Brain-Child-Revolutionary-Strategies-Developing/dp/0553386697" target="_blank">The Wholebrain Child</a>. It is an impressive book as it showed me not only my children’s possibilities, but also my own. Neuroplasticity isn’t only about academic or technical achievement, it is also true for emotion recognition. I strongly recommend this book - I keep it with me to refer to it from time to time. This is practice to improve my neuroplasticity on neuroplasticity.

      <h4 style="width: 100%; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 20px;">Growth Mind</h4>
      <p>
        Growth mindset is when someone believes that their intelligence can grow, i.e. they are capable of being smarter and smarter. The concept reflects on the principles of neuroplasticity. Now that we know the scientific fact that the brain is capable of being reshaped throughout our whole life, the next step is to ensure that we truly believe that we have the potential to grow. It is so important becuase it provides the fundamental motivation for someone to be willing to keep trying.      
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve known the concepts of neuroplasticity and growth mindset for a while thanks to my research on how to be a good parent. This exploration helped me to consolidate my knowledge on this and reminded me to take a step back and see how my growth mindset is doing. These concepts are straight forward but yet a life-long task to master them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning of each week during my learning journey, I could take 10 minutes to do a meditation to tell myself that my brain can grow and it is ready to wire for the new knowledge that I’m about to dump into it. This meditation exercise can be done at any time during the week if I start to doubt myself.      
      </p>      
      <p>
        The article <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means" target="_blank">"What Having a 'Growth Mindset' Actually Means"</a> helps me to get a better understanding of growth mindset and it shows me the three common misconceptions. The important thing is that it points out that everyone has a mixed mindset of fixed and growth mindset. If I find myself having a fixed mindset on something, I should know that it is normal and I can work on that if I want to.
      </p>
      <h4 style="width: 100%; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 20px;">My Learning Journey</h4>
      <p>
        The concepts of neuroplasticity builds me the confidence that my brain is still evolving and it can certainly absorb the new knowledge and techiniques that I urge to learn. The concepts of growth mindset will work like a compass for me during the learning journey to direct me to the right way - study hard, study right, accept any failures and keep trying.
