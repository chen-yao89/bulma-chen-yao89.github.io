        New things that I’ve learnt
      </h4>
      <p>
        1. I realized the importance to sit down and reflecting on my identity, culture and values. It helps my self-recognition and it reminds me of some basic things about myself that I’ve forgotten or lost in my busy life.
      <p>
        2. Culture’s impact lasts longer than I thought and its power is stronger than I expected. Living in a westernized country made me question myself from time to time whether I could still survive if I ever move back to my country. After the reflection, I’m confident that what my culture has given me during my childhood is still there and all those worries are not necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. The correct concept of growth mind. It’s not just about believing that I’m smart enough to do things, but keeping a mind that my brain is capable of learning new things if I’m willing to commit to it. This changes everything and sets my attitude right towards learning.
      </p>
      <h4 style="width: 100%; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Role of values, empathy, self-awareness
      </h4>
      <p>
        Values play a vital role in anything because it is the foundation of every single decision that I make. It has an impact on deciding how I want to apply my learnings and the impact of my programming on others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Empathy is important when it comes to teamwork, or even just group studying. It forces me to think about others from their point of view before saying and doing anything that might have an impact on others. I’m not saying that everything I say or do depends on other people’s feelings. But it is very important that we are not 100% self-centred. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-awareness is similar to empathy, but it is to care for myself instead of others. I could be frustrated when having some obstacles in learning and programming without realizing it. This actually slows down the whole progress and reduced my confidence. Being aware of what’s happening inside me, physically and emotionally, will make the whole journey easier and more enjoyable.
      </p>
      <h4 style="width: 100%; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 20px;">Surprises</h4>
      <p>
        It surprised me that some learning cores (identity, value, culture, neuroplasticity and growth mind) are presented here. I’ve learned all of them as a parent trying to make my child thrive in her life. During my own readings, I do realize how these concepts do not only benefit children, adults like us actually benefit even more. 
      </p>
      <h4 style="width: 100%; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 20px;">Most challenging aspects</h4>
      <p>
        Lots of readings. I like reading detective stories, I could read the complete Sherlock Homes collections in English and Chinese. But reading concepts has always been a big challenge to me. As I type, I realized that it is probably because I prefer visualized learning instead of reading words. I always prefer to watch a video about the same concept.      
      </p>
      <h4 style="width: 100%; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 20px;">Why core learning</h4>
      <p>
        Learning how to program is hard. Trying to learn what others take 3 or 4 years to learn in university in 3 months makes it extremely hard. When there is a lot of stress and negative energy floating around, all the concepts that we’ve learned in core learning become great tools that we could use to help us get through this tough time.
      </p>      
      <h4 style="width: 100%; text-align: left; font-weight: 600; font-size: larger; margin-bottom: 20px;">Waste of time?</h4>
      <p>
        Studying core learning is never a waste of time. It is a surprise but in a good way. Without all the core learning, I won’t be able to realize the importance of taking some reasonable time off to reflect on my condition during practising programming. I had some issues that took me hours to work on during the foundation, some turned out to be a misunderstanding of the requirements, some turned out to be a really difficult challenge, and some turned out that I just need some time off. It did stress me out when I discovered that I spend hours on something that wasn’t asked for from the beginning. But when I took a moment to reflect, I was glad that I didn’t waste my time, I was learning something new, even if that wasn’t within the scope.
